    \caption{\label{fig:properties} \textbf{IQM return of the different categorizations.} Each marker represents the interquartile-mean performance of an individual group. The x-axis shows the ID performance and the y-axis the OOD performance. Especially, ViT representations or representations trained on diverse data perform well in the OOD setting. Sequential data seem to help in ManiSkill2 and Miniworld but not in DMC. Categorization plots for each environment individually can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appx_properties_aggregated}.}
