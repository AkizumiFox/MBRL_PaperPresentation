    \caption{\label{fig:umaps}\textbf{UMAP projections of DreamerV3 (top row) and TD-MPC2 (bottom row) encodings} using different representations as input. The points are color coded by the real perceived reward. Each point represents a visited state in the \texttt{Pendulum Swingup} environment of DMC. The representations learned from scratch better disentangle low and high reward states whereas the embeddings of the PVRs are more entangled.}
