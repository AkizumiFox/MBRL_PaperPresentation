    \caption{\label{fig:data_efficiency} \textbf{Normalized ID performance and data-efficiency comparison} on DMC, ManiSkill2 and Miniworld environments between the different representations. Each line represents the mean over all runs with a given representation, the shaded area represents the corresponding standard deviation. Solid lines represent DreamerV3 runs, whereas dashed lines indicate TD-MPC2 experiments. Especially in the DMC experiments, representations trained from scratch outperform all PVRs also in terms of data-efficiency. Curves of each environment individually can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appx_performance_curves}.}
