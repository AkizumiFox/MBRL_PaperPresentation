    \caption{\textbf{Ablation of transformer blocks in VC-1.} Using \sfrac{2}{3} of VC-1 results in similar performance compared to the full model. Transformer blocks near the final one seam to offer as much information as the final output. With only \sfrac{1}{3} of VC-1 the performance drops significantly. It seems that earlier representations do not offer enough information for the MBRL agent to perform better or similarly.}
