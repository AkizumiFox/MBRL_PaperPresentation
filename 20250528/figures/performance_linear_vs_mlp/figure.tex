    \caption{\label{fig:performance_linear_vs_mlp} \textbf{Performance comparison with representations using linear layers versus multilayer perceptrons.} Top row shows normalized ID and OOD performance on DMC environments whereas the bottom row shows the performance on ManiSkill2 environments. Differences between MLPs and linear layers are negligible.}
